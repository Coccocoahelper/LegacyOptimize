## FAQ

#### Is this a Patcher port for Legacy Fabric?
Yes, but this mod isn’t exactly a Patcher port. It’s a mod that combines features from many different mods to enhance Minecraft. In other words, it doesn’t just port Patcher, it ports multiple mods together into one all-in-one mod. However, porting mods to keep them identical to the original can be difficult and time-consuming.

#### Can this mod be used with any version of Minecraft?
No, this mod only supports Minecraft version 1.8.9.
